# QR Code Sharing Guide

This document explains how to create and share QR codes for Locus artifacts.

## Generating a QR Code
1. Upload your Locus artifact (e.g., prompt, markdown, script) to a URL shortening service.
2. Take the shortened URL and use it to generate a QR code using the provided script.
3. Share the QR code with others to allow them to easily access your artifact.

## Example
- Upload your prompt to a service like Bitly.
- Use the shortened URL with the `generate_qr.sh` script to create a scannable QR code.

For more information, refer to the scripts available in the repository.
