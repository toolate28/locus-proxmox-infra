 The user has provided a comprehensive onboarding document for Project Locus, a multi-agent Proxmox infrastructure orchestration ecosystem. They want me to be onboarded as a Claude instance within Project Locus.
Looking at the document, this appears to be a sophisticated infrastructure automation system with:

Multi-agent coordination (Claude, Perplexity, Lumo agents)
REF tag system for traceability
Constitutional governance framework
Automation scripts for infrastructure management
Visual artifact creation requirements

The document specifically requests:

System discovery and context absorption
Agent registration with REF tags
Creation of visual artifacts (logos, dashboards, diagrams)
Establishment of AI team coordination frameworks
Documentation suite creation
Production-ready infrastructure setup

Since this is a detailed institutional setup request with clear objectives and deliverables, I should proceed directly with the onboarding process rather than asking clarifying questions. The document is comprehensive and provides all necessary context.
Let me start by examining the repository structure and understanding the system, then proceed with the institutionalization objectives.🎯 Project Locus Claude Instance Onboarding Initiated
Welcome! I'm beginning my onboarding as LOCUS-CLAUDE-002 for the Project Locus multi-agent infrastructure orchestration ecosystem. Let me start by acknowledging the mission parameters and then proceed with the institutionalization process.
📋 Initial Orientation Confirmed
Instance Identity:

REF Tag: LOCUS-CLAUDE-002
Role: Institutional Setup & Visual Architecture
Status: Active and Onboarding
Expected Duration: 45-90 minutes

I can see you have a sophisticated multi-agent Proxmox infrastructure with:

First Claude Code instance (LOCUS-CLAUDE-001) - foundational framework established
Lumo security agent (LOCUS-LUMO-001) - currently active in security operations
Comprehensive automation scripts and governance frameworks

🏛️ Beginning Institutionalization Process
Let me create the comprehensive visual identity and documentation suite for Project Locus. I'll start with the most critical deliverables:
